My name is Zeid Hamadeh. I'm a Palestinian-Canadian researcher and amateur bioinformatician trying to answer meaningful biological questions about cancer and DNA repair using memes and redbull.

In my spare time I compete in beach volleyball tours across the continent and sometimes even in the World Tour. I train year round at Kits beach, rain or shine...or snow. And I also enjoy camping, snowboarding, surfing, roadtripping and yoga!
