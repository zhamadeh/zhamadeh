Twins have historically been a model for understanding the age-old question -- nature or nurture? To find out what holds more influence over some traits, we hold the genes constant in identical twins and attribute all variation in traits to environmental influence. Environmental factors such as diet and lifestyle exert its effects through what we now know as the epigenome: chemical modifications to our genome that regulate gene expression. An important distinction here is that the genome undergoes very few changes and has a relatively high tolerance for mutations whereas the epigenome is very plastic and constantly undergoes changes reflected by changes in environmental factors. The important question here is what do we really pass to our offspring that wasn't already given to us? Darwin taught us that evolution by natural selection takes millions of years. So even though we might accumulate some harmful disease-causing DNA mutations in our genome during our lifetime, it is unlikely these mutations will occur in our germline cells that get passed to our offspring. As the first sign of evidence that there acquired changes in our epigenome may be inherited through our germline came in mid-1900s during the Dutch famine.

In 1945, a German blockade cut off all food imports to western provinces of the Netherlands during World War II starving millions of Dutch citizens for months. Famine was a relatively rare phenomenon in that era which allowed the newly emerged fields of data science and epidemiology to study the health effects of food deprivation without having to intentionally subject people to these conditions. Cohort studies that followed pregnant women from the famine and their affected children discovered health defects much later in life for their offspring. The children born from motherâ€™s alive during the Dutch famine were smaller than expected having lighter than normal birth weights. They grew up just fine but were far more susceptible to cardiovascular problems, obesity and diabetes later in life than children whose mothers did not experience famine. Essentially, environmental factors experienced during the mothers' lifespan were altering the epigenome of children born during this era through a novel genetic mechanism known as trans-generational epigenetic inheritance. 

This phenomenon, whereby epigenetic modifications acquired during the lifespan of an individual are transferred to the germline and inherited by the offspring provides a novel genetic mechanism of inheritance contrary to evolution by natural selection that takes thousands of generations. This would explain how humans could make short-term adaptations to their environment within the span of one generation without having to wait for random mutations to arise in a population that confer a selective advantage and the thousands of generations needed to bring this mutation to fixation in a population. But it remains unclear if these trans-generational effects could be attributed to epigenetic inheritance for three reasons.

1. Mammalian fertilization requires a genome-wide reprogramming of all epigenetic marks to create the stem cells that will go on to form every cell in the body. This reprogramming removes all epigenetic marks that existed in the genome of either germ cell and over the course of fetal development, the epigenome is rewritten from scratch.

2. Studies that quote the Dutch famine as evidence of epigenetic inheritance failed to account for possible *in-utero* effects that starvation and malnutrition have on the developing fetus. Acquired epigenetic changes may actually be attributed to maternal malnutrition during pregnancy instead of acquired epigenetic changes passing to the germline and being inherited during fertilization.

3. Genetic inheritance alone cannot explain why we resemble our parents. We also inherit non-genetic factors such as culture and lifestyle that over a lifetime may recapitulate an epigenome that resembles that of our parents.

These three reasons I think are enough to say we have not found a mechanism of trans-generational epigenetic inheritance in humans (yet). Which is important for a few reasons. We cannot help what DNA or epigenome we pass on to our child but what we can influence is the cultural and lifestyle factors we raise them in.
