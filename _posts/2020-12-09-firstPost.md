DNA is a very stable molecule, hence why you can still find ancient DNA preserved after thousands of years. In fact, DNA is the only biological molecule that doesn’t turn over.  It repairs itself unlike protein and RNA. Therefore, dynamic networks of DNA damage detection and repair genes have evolved over millions of years, conserved across taxonomic domain to prevent this molecule from accumulating damage that turns into mutations. It's estimated that DNA damage due to normal metabolic processes inside the cell are as high as one million molecular lesions per cell per day yet the most recent estimates of muttation rates is much lower making the accuracy of DNA repair machineyr somwhere on the scale of 99.99999% efficient.

In the last couple decades, an appreciation for the critical role of DNA repair in cancer has slowly become more apparent. It is now widely accepted that cancer cells suppress these mechanisms either to initiatie cancer or to continue uncontrollable proliferation. This is exemplified by the many cancer prone diseases of mutated DNA repair genes such as with thee RecQ class of helicases, where deficiencies in 4 of 5 of these genes results in autosomal recessive disorders of genome instability, premature aging and cancer predisposition. Therefore, our lab among many others study DNA repair genes and mechanisms to better understand cancer and what deficiencies in repair can be exploited for theraputic benefit. To date these mechanisms of DNA repair and fork restart remain enigmatic, until new technologies can shed light on these highly dynamic and redundant networks of genes.
