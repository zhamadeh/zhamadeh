My name is Zeid Hamadeh. I'm a Palestinian-Canadian cancer researcher and amateur bioinformatician trying to answer meaningful biological questions about health and disease using memes and redbull. 

Before I was born my family was forced to leave our homeland in the Arab world as refugees before immigrating to Canada and having me in Ottawa, Ontario. I grew up all across southern Ontario cultivating my craft as a professional volleyball athlete in hopes of getting scouted by universities across North America. I had some interest in American schools but ultimately decided to accept an offer to the University of Southern Ontario in quaint London, ON as an interdisciplinary medical science student and varsity volleyball player. I lived off Spoke bagels and King Richie's pizza the whole time (if you're familiar). When I finally completed my last undergraduate exam, I packed up my things (since my lease was over) and couch-crashed for "a couple days max I promise". Three weeks later, I got in my tiny 2009 Pontiac Wave and drove across the country in 12 days to start my Master's in Genome Science and Technology (GSAT) at UBC in the summer of 2018, seeing and meeting a few friends along the way.

Right up until the spring of 2020, things were going smoothly. I had completed a diverse course load at UBC entailing statistics, computer science, bioinformatics, entrepreneurship and math. I spent a few months on exchange in the Netherlands working with a collaborating lab. And my own research was finally proving fruitful. Then in March I suffered a moderate concussion and a global pandemic changed everything.

I spent a few weeks in dark room therapy (an outdated and not medically recommended form of therapy) unable to focus or even think and then began an 8-month long rehabilitation process that made me reassess a few things. For one, I was forced to reinvent my sporadic, say-yes-to-everything, best-ideas-at-2-am lifestyle and prioritize the things that would improve my symptoms. I started eating at the same time every day, sleeping at the same time and exercising at the same time each day until that mundane routine started driving me crazy. Eventually I found a happy balance of sporadic and predictable that perfectly satisfied what I was deprived of for so many months.

Finally, one summer afternoon on a quarantine-friendly walk with my supervisor, Dr Peter Lansdorp, I asked about any PhD prospects. He said he has been looking for a young student to design a new technology for sequencing genomic DNA and RNA at the same time in single cells. I pitched him a few ideas and we agreed I should make the transfer into a PhD program. Now I spend my days designing experiments and writing scripts to test aspects of single cell template strand sequencing and RNA-sequencing.
